# Predictive Modeling for Airline Booking using Random Forest

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict customer booking completion using a Random Forest Classifier. The analysis includes the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing a dataset with features such as sales channel, trip type, customer preferences, and flight details. Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance predictive power, including the total number of extra services requested.

Model Training: Building and training a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of booking completion, with a focus on handling class imbalance using class_weight='balanced'.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters for better performance. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data, engineer meaningful features, train predictive models, and evaluate performance. This project is an example of how data science can be applied to understand and predict customer behavior in the airline industry.
